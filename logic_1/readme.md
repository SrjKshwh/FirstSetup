# Documentation for WordSearch project
My project is about the interactive word search, in which we will ask 3 words from the user and rest of the 7 words from my predefined list. On the base of these total 10 words, the word search grid will be arranged using my Python program. 

This grid will be shown on the left side of the GUI. On the right side of the GUI, there will be an input box, below that it will be a timer, and there will be the list of 10 words with a cross or tick. So, as soon as the user starts working on it, they will start the timer, and if they find a new word, they will check out that word from the list below.

## Core Features Recap
- User Inputs 3 Words

- Add 7 Predefined Words with above enterd 3 words (Total = 10 words)

- Generate Word Search Grid with all 10 words placed

- GUI Layout:
   -   Left side: Grid display
   -   Right side:
      - Input box (for user guesses)
      - Timer (start when the user clicks “Start”)
      - Word list with ✓ or ✗ next to each
      - Scoring: Show time taken and number of correct words found at the end


## Usage
   Will get to learn about string manipulation, file handeling, user input, GUI design, and game logic, which makes it both fun and educational.


## ALGORITHM
1. Start
2. Asking 3 words from user (as input).
3. Adding above asked 3 words to a list ; in that list add 7 more words from a predefined list of words.
4. Display a matrix of 15 x 15; this matrix contain all 10 words from step 2 in GUI.
5. Start the timer of 5 minutes (show the timer on GUI); also show the 10 words on the bottom right corner of the GUI.
6. If the user cannot finish all the search in 5 minutes then user can reset the timer again.
7. As soon as user finds the words she/he can mark the word as "found/check it".
8. Finish.
